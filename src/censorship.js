/**
 * Write a function which returns a function to replace forbidden words in string by * symbols
 * Array 'forbidden' is specifying the words you have to detect and replace by *
 * Amount of * symbols should be equal word length (words and spaces between them if there are many words)
 *
 * ATTENTION: There might be one or several symbols '\n' or '\\n'.
 * That's a special symbol declaring a new line and should stay in a final string.
 *
 * Example:
 * forbidden = ['ship', 'blow', 'blew up']
 * str = 'There once was a ship that put to sea\nThe name of the ship was the Billy of Tea\nThe winds blew up, her bow dipped down\nOh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)'
 * str = 'There once was a **** that put to sea\nThe name of the **** was the Billy of Tea\nThe winds *******, her bow dipped down\nOh ****, my bully boys, **** (huh)'
 * @param {Array} forbidden
 * @returns {function}
